"fnSeqID","Footnote"
"1","Annual Water Balance Study (multiple regression estimation methodology)."
"2","Due to lack of sufficient data, only evaporation is counted here."
"3","Estimation based on EVT data available for neighboring countries, such as Croatia, Serbia and some data are from Hungary, Italy, Slovenia. These data show that up to 60% of precipitation in the region is contained in real evapotranspiration."
"4","The Actual Evapotranspiration was calculated as 30.24% of the Precipitation, according to the results of the report Surface Water Balance Period 1970-2002, elaborated by ICE-CRRH, 2007."
"5","Estimate."
"6","Values ​​calculated by deduction of the annual water runoff (estimated at an average runoff coefficient of 4%, for permeable soil basin in the Sahelian zone, ORSTOM (Office de la recherche scientifique et technique outre-mer) experimental reference) and infiltrated water (estimated using a method inspired by the Mali Hydrogeological Synthesis Study of 1990: Infiltrated Water = 0.3 x Rain +70, for an annual rain between 300 and 700 mm)."
"7","Data refer to the hydrologic year (November to October)."
"8","Actual evapotranspiration estiamted as percent of rainfall (60%) based on: Jacobson, G. & Hill, P.J. (1988) Hydrogeology and groundwater resources of Nauru Island, Central Pacific Ocean. Canberra, ACT, Bureau of Mineral Resources."
"9","Definition differs, see Eurostat metadata."
"10","The values for precipitation, evapotranspiration and internal flow for the years 2000-2015 were estimated by the Environmental Economics Unit of the National Environmental Authority, due to the fact that the responsible entity has not provided the information. The estimation was made by the method of variation of the monitoring stations."
"11","Total evaporation is calculated as total average  for the republic , where are located 6 stations, multiplied by the area of the republic."
