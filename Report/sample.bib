abstract = {The temporal structure of heat waves having substantial human impact varies widely, with many featuring a compound structure of hot days interspersed with cooler breaks. In contrast, many heat wave definitions employed by meteorologists include a continuous threshold‐exceedance duration criterion. This study examines the hazard of these diverse sequences of extreme heat in the present, and their change with global warming. We define compound heat waves to include those periods with additional hot days following short breaks in heat wave duration. We apply these definitions to analyze daily temperature data from observations, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory global climate model simulations of the past and projected climate, and synthetically generated time series. We demonstrate that compound heat waves will constitute a greater proportion of heat wave hazard as the climate warms and suggest an explanation for this phenomenon. This result implies that in order to limit heat‐related mortality and morbidity with global warming, there is a need to consider added vulnerability caused by the compounding of heat waves.
Plain Language Summary
Heat waves are multiday periods of extremely hot temperatures and among the most deadly natural disasters. Studies show that heat waves will become longer, more numerous, and more intense with global warming. However, these studies do not consider the implications of multiple heat waves occurring in sequence, or “compounding.” In this study, we analyze physics‐based simulations of Earth's climate and temperature observations to provide the first quantifications of hazard from compound heat waves. We demonstrate that compound events will constitute a greater proportion of heat wave risk with global warming. This has important policy implications, suggesting that vulnerability from prior heat waves will be increasingly important to consider in assessing heat wave risk and that heat wave warning systems that currently primarily consider future‐predicted weather should also account for the recent history of weather.
Key Points
Hazard from temporally compound heat waves will disproportionately increase with global warming
Increase is controlled by mean shift in temperature and average local weather, not change in weather
Vulnerability from prior heat waves should be considered in assessing heat wave risk},

abstract = {Air conditioning of dwellings in developing countries is currently rather rare, but increasing personal income is expected to change that. This study examined the potential energy demand for cooling in the 50 most populous metropolitan areas of the world, and assessed the incremental demand in developing countries that this would create on top of the current energy demand due to heating. The analysis used local cooling and heating degree-day data. The main results are as follows: (1) Most of the largest metropolitan areas are in developing countries (38 out of 50), and most of them, in turn, are in warm to hot climates. (2) All but two of the top 30 metropolitan areas in terms of cooling degree days are in developing countries. (3) The potential cooling demands are greater than heating demands in most of the metropolitan areas that are in developing countries (24 out of 38). The main implication of these findings is that increasing personal income is likely to lead to an unprecedented increase in energy demand in many developing countries. For example, the potential cooling demand in metropolitan Mumbai is about 24% of the demand for the entire United States.},

abstract = {In warming Europe, we are witnessing a growth in urban population with aging trend, which will make the society more exposed and vulnerable to extreme weather events. In the period 1950–2015 the occurrence of extreme heat waves increased across European capitals. As an example, in 2010 Moscow was hit by the strongest heat wave of the present era, killing more than ten thousand people. The cold extremes will have decreasing tendency as global warming progresses, however due to higher variability of future climates, the cold wave hazard may remain locally important threat. Moreover, the heat and cold-related mortality will be enhanced with foreseen demographic evolution in European cities.
Here we focus on larger metropolitan areas of European capitals (EU28 plus Moscow, Oslo and Zurich). By using an ensemble of eight EURO-CORDEX models under the RCP8.5 scenario, we detected heat waves and cold waves events by deployment of Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily and its cold wave counterpart. We introduce a ranking procedure based on ensemble predictions using the median of metropolitan grid cells for each capital, and population density as a proxy to quantify the future exposure.
All the investigated European metropolitan areas will be more vulnerable to extreme heat in the coming decades. Based on the impact ranking, results reveal that cold waves will represent some threat in mid of the century but they will not be the major threat in any of European capitals, and that they are projected to completely vanish by the end of this century. On the contrary, in near, but even more so in distant future, extreme heat events in European capitals will be not exclusive to traditionally exposed areas such as the Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula. The ranking of European capitals based on their exposure to extreme heat is of paramount importance to decision makers in order to mitigate the heat related mortality, especially with the foreseen increase of global mean temperature. Furthermore, this simple comparative indicator helps communicating the global, complex and impersonal issue of climate change locally thus contributing to raise awareness and call for action.},
